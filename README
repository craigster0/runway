A project to help you take flight with a storage system (get it?).

This sets up a swift-all-in-one (SAIO) in an lxc container. Eventially
it will also include projects like swift3, metadata searching, and
filesystem access.

This project has threee target use cases:
 - Developers looking to contribute code to any of the constituent projects
 - Developers looking for an API test target against which to write apps
 - Something easily consumable for CI to integrate into a QA process

Requires a lvm volume group named swift-runway-vg01 and assumes it's
running on an Ubuntu 16.04 host.

Start with `start.sh`. Clean everything up with
`delete_all_runway_containers.py`. Because of the lvm commands, these
need to be run as root.
