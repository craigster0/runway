# Install every component other than libec, swiftclient, and swift
# If a workspace is found, first we'll try to find an install command. If there
# isn't one, let's try to find a script named install.sh in the root of the
# component.
#
# If we're not using a manifest, stick to the old behavior: try to find a
# script named install.sh at the root of each top-level dir in the workspace.
#
# If any way to install is found, execute it inside the container.
